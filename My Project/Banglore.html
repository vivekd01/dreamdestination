<p><font size="6"><i>Bangalore, now called Bengaluru, is the capital city of Karnataka in south India.
 The city has earned several names such as Silicon Valley of India, Pub Capital of India, Air
 Conditioned City, and City of Gardens. Prior to the IT revolution, Bangalore was known as 
 Pensioners' Paradise. Now, it's a wonderful blend of past and present. Although Bangalore 
 may not have as many iconic attractions as other major cities in India, it does have a
 . great mix of history, architecture, culture, spirituality, and nature. 
Here are the top tourist places to visit in Bangalore.</i></font></p><br><br>

<p><font size="14" color="#CC0066">1. Banglore Palace</font></p><br>
<img src="images\b1.jpg" height="500" width="1000" style="border-style:dotted;color:blue;"> </img><br><br>
<p><font size="6">Built in 1887 by Chamaraja Wodeyar, Bangalore Palace is inspired by England's 
Windsor Castle. This evocative palace has Tudor-style architecture, with fortified towers, arches,
 green lawns, and elegant woodcarvings in its interiors. The royal family still lives there. 
 On display are all kinds of memorabilia, 
family photos, and portraits. The palace is open from 10 a.m. until 5.30 p.m. </font></p><br>

<p><font size="14" color="#CC0066">2. National Gallery of Modern Art</font></p><br>
<img src="images\b2.jpg" height="500" width="1000" style="border-style:dashed;color:white;"> </img><br><br>
<p><font size="6">If you're an art lover, don't miss visiting the National Gallery of Modern Art
 on Palace Road. This gallery, which opened in 2009, is the third such one in India (the others
 are in Delhi and Mumbai). It's housed in a Colonial mansion with a garden setting and has two 
 interconnected wings. The old are features works from the early 18th century up until India's 
 Independence, while the new one displays works from a large number of modern and contemporary 
 artists. There's a cafe on the premises as well. 
The gallery is open daily, ​except Monday, from 10 a.m until 5 p.m.</font></p><br>

<p><font size="14" color="#CC0066">3. Tipu Sultan's Palace and Fort</font></p><br>
<img src="images\b3.jpg" height="500" width="1000" style="border-style:inset;color:orange;"> </img><br><br>
<p><font size="6">Situated inside the Bangalore Fort area, Tipu Sultan's Palace was originally
 built by Chikkadeva Raya in mud. Later, Hyder Ali started reconstruction in Indo-Islamic 
 architecture. This was completed by his son, Tipu Sultan, in 1791. The Hindu temple seen 
 in the courtyard of the fort is the proof of Tipu Sultan's religious tolerance. The palace 
 is open daily from 8.30 a.m. until 5.30 p.m.
 Combine visiting it with nearby Krishna Rajendra Market.</font></p><br>
 
 <p><font size="14" color="#CC0066">4. Krishna Rajendra (KR) Market</font></p><br>
 <img src="b4.jpg" height="500" width="1000" style="border-style:double;color:black;"> </img><br><br>
<p><font size="6">This vivid, traditional local market is an assault on the senses and a treat
 for photographers. In the middle of it is Bangalore's bustling flower market. Go there in the
 early morning to best experience the colors and crowds, when piles of fresh stock are being 
 unloaded and sold.
 The market also sells a variety of fresh produce, spices, and copper items. </font></p><br>
 
 <p><font size="14" color="#CC0066">5. Lalbagh Botanical Garden</font></p><br>
 <img src="images\b5.jpg" height="500" width="1000" style="border-style:double;color:red;"> </img><br><br>
 <p><font size="6">This expansive garden started out as a private
 Mughal-style garden for the city's royal rulers. It was established in 1760 by Hyder Ali and
 later extended by his son Tipu Sultan. It now covers 240 acres, and derives its name from the
 red roses that bloom throughout the year there. The garden is said to have the most diverse species of plants in the world. Its focal point is a majestic glasshouse, built in 1889 to commemorate the visit of the Prince of Wales. It was designed along the lines of the Crystal Palace in London.

The garden is open from 6.00 a.m. to 7.00 p.m. throughout the year. It takes on a festive 
look during India's Independence Day and Republic Day celebrations, with a captivating show 
of over 200 varieties of flowers. The show also features an exhibition of hybrid vegetables.</font></p><br>

<p><font size="14" color="#CC0066">6. Cubbon Park</font></p><br>
<img src="images\b6.jpg" height="500" width="1000" style="border-style:double;color:purple;"> </img><br><br>
 <p><font size="6">Occupying a 300-acre area in Bangalore's business district, Cubbon Park 
 is a popular place for walkers, joggers, nature lovers, and anyone who just wants to laze 
 around. The park was named after the erstwhile Commissioner of Bangalore, Sir Mark Cubbon.
 Many ornamental and flowering trees, both exotic and indigenous, can be found there.
 Kids will enjoy the special Bal Bhavan play area and aquarium inside the park.</font></p><br>
 
 <p><font size="14" color="#CC0066">7. Vidana Soudha</font></p><br>
<img src="images\b7.jpg" height="500" width="1000" style="border-style:double;color:gray;"> </img><br><br> 
<p><font size="6">Built in 1954, Vidana Soudha is a landmark of Bangalore, next to Cubbon Park. 
This enormous building is a massive example of neo-Dravidian architecture, with four domes on 
its four corners. It houses the Legislative Chamber of Karnataka Government, as well as 
accommodates many government departments. 
Unfortunately, it's not open to the public but is stunningly illuminated at night.</font></p><br>

<p><font size="14" color="#CC0066">8. Ulsoor Lake</font></p><br> 
 <img src="images\b8.jpg" height="500" width="1000" style="border-style:dashed;color:cyan;"> </img><br><br>
<p><font size="6">Picturesque Ulsoor Lake is spread over an area of 125 acres in the heart of 
the city, north of M.G. Road. It was constructed by Kempegowda II.

 There's also a walking track around the lake.</font></p><br> <br>

    Taj Mahal, also spelled Tadj Mahall, mausoleum complex in Agra, western Uttar Pradesh state, northern India. The Taj Mahal was built by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (reigned 1628 to 58) to immortalize his wife Mumtaz Mahal (Chosen One of the Palace), who died in childbirth in 1631, having been the emperors inseparable companion since their marriage in 1612. Indias most famous and widely recognized building, it is situated in the eastern part of the city on the southern (right) bank of the Yamuna (Jumna) River. Agra Fort (Red Fort), also on the right bank of the Yamuna, is about 1 mile (1.6 km) west of the Taj Mahal.
<br><br>
    In its harmonious proportions and its fluid incorporation of decorative elements, the Taj Mahal is distinguished as the finest example of Mughal architecture, a blend of Indian, Persian, and Islamic styles. Other attractions include twin mosque buildings (placed symmetrically on either side of the mausoleum), lovely gardens, and a museum. One of the most beautiful structural compositions in the world, the Taj Mahal is also one of the worlds most iconic monuments, visited by millions of tourists each year. The complex was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1983.

A city predominantly made of red sandstone, Fatehpur Sikri was founded in 1571 century by Mughal Emperor Akbar. It is essentially a fortified city built by the king and had been the capital of his Empire for fifteen years. Now a UNESCO world heritage site, it is home to Jodha Bai's Palace, Jama Mosque, Buland Darwaza, and Tomb of Salim Chisti among many other famous monuments. Derived from Arab and central Asian tent encampments, the Imperial Complex is a work of pavilions arranged in formal geometry on a piece of land.<br><br>
    Today we are going to talk about Fatehpur sikri. The place is known as the royal city at Fatehpur Sikri, 26 miles west of Agra in Uttar Pradesh. Fatehpur Sikri was established as the capital of the Mughal Empire in 1571 by Emperor Jalal-ud-din Mohammad Akbar. Fatehpur Sikri played a very important role during 1571 to 1585. Jalal-ud-din Mohammad Akbar abandoned Fatehpur sikri due to his expedition to the Punjab and later in 1610 it was abandoned altogether. So let us gather a little more information about Fatehpur sikri.

    Often referred to as the "Baby Taj Mahal", the tomb of Itimad-ud-daulah is a Mughal mausoleum and often regarded as a copy of the Taj Mahal. This is the first tomb in India made entirely of marble. The tomb was commissioned by Nur Jahan, the wife of Jahangir, for her father Mir Gheyas Beg (later known as Itimad-ud-daulah), who was a minister in the court of Shah Jahan.
    <br><br>
    The tomb of Itimad-ud-daulah marks the transition from the first phase of the Mughal architecture to the second. This was the first structure to make use of pietra dura and the first to be built on the banks of the Yamuna River. It basically consists of Indo-Islamic architecture, with the use of arched entrances and octagonal shaped towers. If you take a bird's eye of Itimad-ud-daulah Tomb, it looks like a jewel box set in a garden. This magnificent mausoleum, built on the banks of Yamuna, was to inspire the construction of one of the wonders of the world "Taj Mahal" in the later years.</font><br><br><br><br><br></td>

While Nanda was head of Gokula, Vrishbhanu was head of Rawal. However, fed up with the atrocities of Mathura’s king Kamsa, both of them with their people shifted to Nandgaon and Barsana. Nanda made Nandishvar hill his home and Vrishbhanu made Bhanugarh hill his permanent abode, which also ultimately became the abode of Radha. Presently, in both the twin towns of Barsana and Nandgaon, there stands the historical temples dedicated to Radha and Krishna on the peak of Nandishvar and Bhanugarh hills respectively. While Nandgaon temple is called the Nand Bhawan, Barsana temple is named after Radha, called Radha Rani temple or Shriji (Shreeji temple).

<img src="images\g3.jpg" height="390" width="850" style="border-style:inset;color:orange;"> </img><br><br>
<p><font size="6">Another heritage from the Portuguese, Fort Aguada has been standing stern on the beach facing the Arabian Sea from 1612 when it was built in order to provide defence against the invading Dutch and the Marathas. It was a grand old fort in its time with the capacity to hold 79 cannons among other weapons of defense. It was one of the prized possessions of the Portuguese. Today, it stands as a famous landmark dividing the Sinquerium Beach and the Candolim Beach.
<br>
There is an old lighthouse standing within the fort which was built in 1864, the oldest lighthouse of its shape and size in India. Fort Aguada is a great place to explore when you are out visiting the Candolim or Sinquerium Beaches. The architecture gives a good insight into the building techniques of old Portuguese architects and it has some amazing views you should really see. 
The old fort provides a good view of the sea and the sunset is reckoned to be lovely..</font></p><br>
 
 <p><font size="14" color="#ff6666">4. Anjuna Beach</font></p><br>
 <img src="images\g4.jpg" height="390" width="850" style="border-style:double;color:black;"> </img><br><br>
<p><font size="6">Goa is one of the most toured places in India. Anjuna, a small village on the North coast of Goa, is amongst those few places to see in Goa which receive a lot of tourists. The Anjuna Beach is arguably amongst the best beaches in India. The beach has the perfect picturesque background with hills.

 <img src="images\g5.jpg" height="390" width="850" style="border-style:double;color:red;"> </img><br><br>
 <p><font size="6">
 Arambol Beach is located in North Goa and first became popular when people came to it in order to escape  Baga and Calangute beach crowd. Today it is famous in its own right and draws several tourists, though not in the quantity that Baga and Calangute do. This is a good beach to visit if you are searching for a place that combines adventure sports in Goa with relaxation. The strong winds on the headlands around the beach make it an ideal spot for paragliding and kitesurfing.

These sports are more well-known on the Arambol scene than the water sports which characterize 
the other beaches of Goa. The village of Arambol is a little distance away so you can get a feel of authentic local life if you step by the house sometime. Accommodation is available in the many huts that have come up around the beach and the food options around the place are many and varied owing to the numerous shacks that line the beach. If you want to step away from the crowd for a bit, you can walk onwards to Mandrem to the south
. Kalacha Beach, north of Arambol, is where the best paragliding in Goa takes place.</font></p><br>

<p><font size="14" color="#ff6666">6. Bom Jesus Basilica</font></p><br>
<img src="images\g6.jpg" height="390" width="850" style="border-style:double;color:purple;"> </img><br><br>
 <p><font size="6">One of the most important of all tourist places in Goa as well as a central landmark for Catholics, the Bom Jesus Basilica is the place in which the incorrupt body of St Francis Xavier is kept. The Church was built in 1605 and the body of the Saint was brought to it in 1622 where it has laid since in its glass mausoleum. The body is perhaps the greatest attraction of the Basilica. A gallery of Modern Art is also a part of the Basilica.

The building is constructed in baroque style and is considered one of the best examples of baroque architecture in India. You can visit the Bom Jesus Basillica in December for the best experience of the tradition as the feast and novena take place at that time along with Christmas celebrations.

 <p><font size="14" color="#ff6666">7. Casino Cruise</font></p><br>
<img src="images\g7.jpg" height="390" width="850" style="border-style:double;color:gray;"> </img><br><br> 
<p><font size="6">This is a little out of the way thing you can indulge in when in Goa. 
A Casino Cruise is essential, at the basic level, a restaurant, but with the additional casino 
features for those who want to try a hand at Vegas style entertainment. The ship is docked on one
 of the many rivers in Goa and is fitted with posh furnishings. The view outside and the rooms inside both make for a great set-up. The casinos are open all round the clock but they really come to life in the night from 9 pm to 3 pm. They are like clubs but instead of the DJ and the party music, you have casino games and low music. They are well-fitted spaces with fine dining options in place including a good selection of drinks.

<p><font size="14" color="#ff6666">8. Anjuna Flea Market</font></p><br> 
 <img src="images\g8.jpg" height="390" width="850" style="border-style:dashed;color:brown;"> </img><br><br>
<p><font size="6">Many tourists associate the name of Anjuna with its wild nightlife and trance scene. But that is just one aspect of Anjuna. The weekly Wednesday Flea Market is another. Flea markets are a quintessential Goan experience and the Anjuna Flea market is one of the best in Goa. It is an interesting off set to the beach scene and is only in operation from mid-November to April. The market first came into existence alongside the party scene at Anjuna beach in the eighties.

Hippies from all over the West congregated here to sell off their personal items, like Levis jeans and other trinkets, in order to fund their stay. Partying does cost a lot after all. But now, the place has evolved into a good-sized market with goods from all over India being sold here. Both Westerners and Indians mill around the place buying and selling and generally enjoying themselves.
 You can snag some great cloth pieces for really good rates at the market.</font></p><br>

<p><font size="14" color="#ff6666">9. Chapora Fort</font></p><br>
<img src="images\g9.jpg" height="390" width="850" style="border-style:dashed;color:orange;"> </img><br><br>
<p><font size="6">Once a huge, commanding structure which was the site of many battles, and which was passed from the hands of the Portuguese to the Indians and back several times in its long history, the Chapora Fort is a good tourist spot in Goa. The present building was constructed in 1717. The Fort rises on the banks of River Chapora and commands a great view of its surroundings. This feature of the fort is what led to the many battles for its possession in the past.

It stands on the head of a natural valley which leads directly to the sea. As you can imagine, the view from the fort is breathtaking. You can spend a couple of hours in this fort exploring 
it and taking in the natural landscape around it. </font></p><br>

<p><font size="14" color="#ff6666">10. Bondla Wildlife Sanctuary</font></p><br>
<img src="images\g10.jpg" height="390" width="850" style="border-style:inset;color:green;"> </img><br><br>
<p><font size="6">There are hundreds of places to visit in Goa, but the Bondla Wildlife Sanctuary is very different from the other Goa tourist places. It is the smallest wildlife sanctuary in Goa and is very famous amongst the children and the environmentalists. The sanctuary has a number of species of flora and fauna. 

The species of animals and plants which one gets to see here are some of the rarest one in India. Many Photography enthusiasts from all over the country come to the Bondla Wildlife Sanctuary just to capture a beautiful moment, of the animals or the plants, in their camera. The area of the sanctuary is just 8 square km, making it the aptest 
wildlife sanctuary as one can tour the entire place in one day itself.</font></p><br> <br>
